- All data management is done through the Firebase console or blog admin interface
- To add new portfolio projects, update the data file at client/src/data/portfolio.ts

## Commands to Remember

- `npm run dev:all` - Run both projects locally
- `npm run build:all` - Build both projects for production
- `npm run deploy` - Build and deploy to Firebase
