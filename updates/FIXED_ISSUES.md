# Fixed Issues in Portfolio Project

This document summarizes the issues fixed to prepare the project for deployment:

## TypeScript Errors Fixed

1. In `QuillHelpers.tsx`:
   - Fixed "Object is possibly undefined" errors by adding optional chaining (`?.`) 
   - Added proper type annotation for `this` in the `customImageHandler` function

2. In `RichTextEditor.tsx`:
   - Fixed argument type mismatch in `setSelection` by providing a proper `RangeStatic` object

3. In `Blog.tsx` and `BlogPost.tsx`:
   - Fixed issues with the `image` property by using the `in` operator to check if the property exists
   - Used conditional access for all `post.image` references

4. In `firebaseBlogService.ts`:
   - Removed the invalid `cacheSizeBytes` parameter from `enableIndexedDbPersistence` function

5. Added missing dependencies:
   - Installed the missing `uuid` package and its type definitions

## Type Definitions Improvement

1. Created proper types for mock blog posts in `Blog.tsx` and `BlogPost.tsx`:
   - Added a new `MockBlogPost` type that extends `Partial<BlogPost>` with the required fields
   - Updated function signatures to accept both real `BlogPost` objects and mock blog post objects

2. Added missing required properties to mock data:
   - Added `published`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` fields to mock posts

## General Build Process Issues

1. The project has a complex build process with multiple components:
   - Main CV/Portfolio site
   - Blog component
   - Combined build script that builds both

2. Build failures appear to be related to:
   - TypeScript errors in the codebase (fixed)
   - Environment/configuration issues with TypeScript and build tools

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. Make sure all TypeScript errors are resolved
2. Try running the build script again
3. Upload the code to GitHub repository
4. Set up Vercel deployment and connect it to the GitHub repo
5. Configure domain name in Vercel
